*Want to see [this template](github-actions-mongodb.vercel.app) in action?*

Well you're in the right place!

## Follow these 3 easy steps to see your token count go up on the [template website](github-actions-mongodb.vercel.app)!

1. Write a few lines of code that you think will benefit others if they see it. *It can be in any language.*
2. Create a file in this repo in the format: `code_snippets/[language_name]/[snippet_name]`. Replace `language_name` with the name of the language you have written the code in, and `snippet_name` with a suitable name for your program. *Eg. If I created a helloworld program in python I'd name it `code_snippets/python/helloworld.py`*
3. Create a pull request and wait for someone to merge it! Once someone merges it, the tokens will be in your account and you will be able to spend them and see the template in action!
